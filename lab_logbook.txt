squares overlap
 -> square2.moveDown(); square2.moveRight();
make all green
 -> call .setColor("green") for all Squares
differences
    diameter vs. size vs. width&height
    squares: xPosition, yPosition
constructor
    sytax is correct
    sematically the int price does not make sense, has to be declared outside, or else it won't actually set the     price.
    -> was right, price is always 0 = standard int-value in java
kara
    Kara01 has no (own) constructor
    KaraWorld01 first calls super-constructor with constants. then sets paint order (duh), and greenfoot speed,        then prepare(). prepare() adds objects to the world (in this case only kara)

Found bluej codePad, was already enabled.
Last one:String OOB exception, oh noes!!!
...
E8
mutator not really neccessary, but why not this further solidifies the function of the counter \_[T]_/

comp clock disp
1
    create isAm
    change setTime
    change constructor
        args
        12h display
    change increment
        inside hour-rollover-if
    test
        rollover works
    change display
        add am/pm
        change 00 to 12
    test 
        change isAm def value to true (so standard constructor gives a 00:00 am time)
    test
        everything ok
2
    copy fresh clocksisplay.java file
    goal: change nothing BUT updateDisplay
    new method for other hour formatting
    add ? etc. am, pmThis
3
    use clock2 for this

1 - tested P1 & P2
  - used assert for P2 and made a new project
2
  - added method listNotes with simple for/each
  - added static test method
3
  - added number variable & added to string
  - kept the for each, because it's still cleaner
4
  - did for loop & i--
  - did Iterator
      - had to import Iterator
  - no particular problems
  - you could forget to use i--
  - you could do i-- before removing
  - it might not be understandable for other people, who might copy it and create further bugs
5
  - added removedSomething boolean
  - set to true when removing
  - error if still on false
6
  - well... no it does not check the size at all o_o
7
  - did stuff just as prelab
  - really weird problem with i starting at 1 -> no number evaluates to prime
  - fixed by rewriting the code and breaking it down into different lines
  - could not recreate the bug -> did not find out what exactly caused it
  - did it wih loop and put it into List -> no probs
8
  - look at code, future Nils ;)
9
  - basics: 2 vars, incrementation -> same functionality as contains
  - added == '?' to have that functionality
